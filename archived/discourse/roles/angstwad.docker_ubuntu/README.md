docker_ubuntu
========

Installs Docker on a version higher than Ubuntu 12.04.
This role differs from other roles in that it specifically follows docker.io installation instructions for each Ubuntu version, 12.04 or 13.04+.

**Please see [this playbook](https://github.com/angstwad/ansible-docker-rackspace) for an example of how to utilize this role.**

This is an example playbook in which I call two playbooks to launch and display information about a Rackspace Cloud server, on top of which I use the *docker_ubuntu* role to install Docker.
```
